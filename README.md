## Introduction
"DATA" is a 501(c)(3) non-profit agency that conducts objective, nonpartisan research and delivers insights that decision-makers can trust. Our funding consists of grants, fundraisers and donations. Over the years, we have experienced funding challenges and have decided to offset our expenses by extablishing a for-profit subsidiary called Data_Grinders. Our primary objective is to generate consistent income while promoting the mission and values of "Data".  

## Overview of the Project & It's Purpose
### **Objectives:**
1. **Revenue Generation** - Provide financial support to fund "Data's" non-profit programs and initiatives.  
2. **Brand Awareness** - Leverage the coffee business to raise awareness about our non-profit's mission.  
3. **Community Engagement** - Create opportunities for local partnerships and employment.  
4. **Sustainability** - Establish a long-term funding source that reduces reliance on donations and grants.

Data_Grinders was decided upon because of a mutual interest in the Coffee Business. Our team wanted to take a deeper look at the variables associated with the Coffee industry. We sought to answer the following questions to make decisions about the quality of product we want to use as well as make deciding factors regarding budget and vendor availablilty.

It provides insight into economic, political, and environmental factors that could affect the coffee supply chain.
Understanding these dynamics ensures Data_Grinders coffee shop can adapt to global changes, optimize sourcing, and maintain competitive pricing and quality over time.
