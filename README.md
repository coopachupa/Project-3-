Overview of the Project & It's Purpose
This project came about from a mutual interest in the Coffee Business. Our team wanted to take a deeper look at the variables associated with Coffee in our country and their connections to other factors/countries of interest. We sought to answer the questions:
1. How have coffee imports and exports changed over time?
2. What countries were the top coffee exporters in 2023 (e.g., coffee beans, roasted, and ground 
coffee)?
3. Which countries were the top coffee consumers in 2023 (e.g., coffee beans, roasted, and ground 
coffee)?
4. What type of coffee is predominantly exported (e.g., acidic or sweet), and what countries score 
highest in overall quality?
5. Which countries consume the most coffee relative to their population, based on consumer data?
