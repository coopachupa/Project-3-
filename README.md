## Introduction
"DATA" is a 501(c)(3) non-profit agency that conducts objective, nonpartisan research and delivers insights that decision-makers can trust. Most of our funding has been through grants, fundraisers and donations. Over the years, we have experienced funding challenges and have decided to offset our expenses by extablishing a for-profit subsidiary called Data_Grinders.

## Overview of the Project & It's Purpose
Data_Grinders was decided upon because of a mutual interest in the Coffee Business. Our team wanted to take a deeper look at the variables associated with the Coffee industry in our country and their connections to other factors/countries of interest. We sought to answer the questions to make decisions about the quality of product we want to present, our budget and vendor availablilty.

a. Visualization by bar chart, we took the value scores from aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, sweetness, and moisture. We took the average scores the combined categories to determine the top 5 countries in overall quality.

#### Vraj
6. Do the countries with the highest overall quality correlate with the countries with the highest exports and imports?

#### Nurmaa
