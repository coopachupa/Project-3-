                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    "DATA" is a 501(c)(3) non-profit agency that conducts objective, nonpartisan research 
                    and delivers insights that decision-makers can trust. Our funding consists of grants, 
                    fundraisers, and donations. Over the years, we have experienced funding challenges and 
                    have decided to offset our expenses by establishing a for-profit subsidiary called Data Grinders. 
                    Our primary objective is to generate consistent income while promoting the mission and values of "DATA."

                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    Data Grinders was decided upon because of a mutual interest in the coffee business. 
                    Our team wanted to acquire a deeper understanding of the variables associated with the coffee industry. 
                    We sought to gather the following information to make decisions and answer questions that we, 
                    our Board of Directors, investors, and others may have about our chosen subsidiary.
